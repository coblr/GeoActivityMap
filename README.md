# Geo Activity Map

Map for showing realtime geographic activity.

### Installation

1) Clone repo

2) `npm install`

3) `npm run build`

For developing, you can use `npm run watch`.

### Notes

While this application uses Angular 1.x, it also uses webpack which means that all the angular code is written using Common JS syntax. It might look a little different than many of the online AngularJS examples.

### TODO

* Figure out how to have multiple apps, but a single application. Basically, how do you have nested modules in CommonJS?
* Figure out how to have angular and other vendor files in a separate file (common.js) from application code.
